Here something that I learned through the tutorial:
- Association between objects (aggregation relationship --> Song can be independent from Album)
- Create class objects
- Constructors
- Functions
- For-each loop, while loop, switch cases
- LinkedList
- ArrayList
- The most important "ListIterator" interface to play the next or previous songs
